- 👋 Hi, I’m @MonkeyLegacy
- 👀 I’m interested in ... coding, computers, mining, cryptocurrency, technology, future, space, travel, innovation, books, learning, teaching, helping, growing, living!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... many subjects on my own time but right now it's back to code basics and where and what code is needed in 2021 and what codes are no longer needed or have been replaced.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... unsure what projects but I hope to find inspiration here and on the internet also to then implement my own ideas (which I have many) I just get caught with limitations as a individual and not knowing how to do specific areas
of the project say finances or managing the video content or content in text or mana gaming social media, I can do it all but I get caught with the need for help but I don't seek it due to the project being just that a small project or idea I have that others won't see the potential in.
This is why I want to and am getting into community's online like here or using GitHub and learning how amazing it is as are the people who use it. Have known if GitHub for a while but I assumed it was just for Devs but it's good for anyone needing info on a website or program that's,
made on or through GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me ... via the messages here on GitHub if there is if not I'll update this soon with my Twitter handle
